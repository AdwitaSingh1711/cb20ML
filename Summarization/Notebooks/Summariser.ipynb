No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know \\nhow to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or \\npursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and \\npain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, \\nexcept to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that \\nhas no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?\"\\n\\n\"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of \\npleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal \\nblame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil \\nand pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and \\nwhen nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in \\ncertain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures \\nhave to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of \\nselection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.\"'}"
